# whitelistbot
 A discord bot for managing ss13 whitelists from discord along with pinging the server pop count
 This was written with linux in mind to be used with the env command 

 'env DISCORD_TOKEN="<Put your discord token here>" WL_LOCATION="<path to your whitelist.txt here>" ~/<path to dir with bot>/whitelist'

 DISCORD_TOKEN: your discord bot api token 
 WL_LOCATION: the global path to the whitelist txt found inside the config file of your server 

it is hardcoded to assume the server is on port 5829 
if someone complains about it being hard coded enough ill maybe fix it when I have the time

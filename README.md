# whitelistbot
 A discord bot for managing ss13 whitelists from discord along with pinging the server pop count
 <\b>
 This was written with linux in mind to be used with the env command 
 <\b>

 `env DISCORD_TOKEN="<Put your discord token here>" WL_LOCATION="<path to your whitelist.txt here>" ~/<path to dir with bot>/whitelist`

 DISCORD_TOKEN: your discord bot api token 
  <\b>
 WL_LOCATION: the global path to the whitelist txt found inside the config file of your server 

it is hardcoded to assume the server is on port 5829 
 <\b>
if someone complains about it being hard coded enough I will maybe fix it when I have the time
